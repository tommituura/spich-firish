# FUTURE 

### Where did we originally aim?

The project was severely downscaled from original ideas:
* sprite graphics
* running, jumping, gravity in gameplay
* more enemies
* moving and shooting kind of enemies
* scoring to take the shot enemies into account
* etc etc ...

### Where did we get to?

In the end, the game ended up being mostly speed-oriented, 
and even my idea of giving a time bonus for shot enemies 
did not happen. 

### Where do we go from here?

On the other hand, I now have more than one idea that are 
probably only going to happen as separate projects.

### 1. This speed-running game:

(Thanks to the course lecturer Arto Vihavainen for these ideas)

* enable the players to play against the "ghost" of best player 
* some kind of speed penalty for hitting wall
* more levels, etc
* better graphics
* sound & music

### 2. Modifying the game to make it involve shooting more

I'm thinking of multiplayer-enabled (with websockets) tank 
battle game:

* moving either in 8 directions or any direction (tank-like in-situ turning etc)
* shooting in all directions
* powerups
* better graphics 
* sound & music

### 3. Platforming game 

The original idea of "Abuse-like" game, a platformer with 360-degrees 
shooting ability, running and jumping

* gravity
* levels
* multiplayer?
* better graphics 
* sound & music

### And when?

Right now I'm a bit swamped with other projects and courses, 
soon including this one: 
http://www.udacity.com/overview/Course/cs255/CourseRev/1
so don't expect much action anytime soon. Also, this project 
and repo might not have much updates any more, I'll probably 
just restart the projects using existing source code from here 
as base. Idea #1 might still hang onto this repo though. Time 
will tell.

None of what I have written here should be construed as any kind 
of promise from anyone, including me. I might have to forget 
doing this due to time reasons. Or not. I'll update this file 
if stuff gets off the ground, that's a promise.
