# spich-firish

Browser-based mouse+keyboard -controlled run'n'gun shooter game with 
JavaScript, Canvas and little bits of additional 
html5 if I get around to it. __NO FLASH__.

### License

MIT.

### Please note!

* This is a university course project for a course about www 
programming, with the deadline set at 13th January 2013.
* This github repository also serves as a medium for handing in 
this project to the instructors for grading.

These facts do have a consequence: 

In the (admittedly unlikely) chance that anyone clones this project and 
wants to improve it, since the turned-in 
version must be 100% my own work (except for libraries and publicly 
available code like Flanagan's ECMA5 fallback functions), 
__I cannot accept any pull requests until 14th Jan 2013__.  
So, if you really want to clone and improve this project, by all means 
do so, but please don't feel bad when I'll keep ignoring your pull 
requests until the turn-in deadline has passed. There's a 
reason for that that has nothing to do with the quality 
of anyone's code. Thanks. :)

Also, please ignore the odd, rough things at the edges. I'm still 
figuring this git and github thing out...

### Building

There are two ways to access the game: index.html and development.html. 
Open either in your browser. To get the changes in code reflected in index.html, 
there is 'minify.sh' script that will join the js files into one 
and run it through the yui compressor. You must edit the script 
by hand to point it to the .jar of yui compressor, which you can get 
here: https://github.com/yui/yuicompressor/downloads

### What does 'spich-firish' mean?

I dunno lol. Spich came into my mind from out of nowhere, maybe from 
"spitfire". I guess. Only after creating 
the repo I googled that spich means _"so weird that it can't even be described"_ 
according to onlineslangdictionary.com. I guess I can live with that, normalcy is 
usually dull anyways. :D
